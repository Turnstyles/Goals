The High Level Goals of Turnstyles

To create components for browser-based games with a storytelling focus. 

More specifically, the creation of multiplayer non-realtime storytelling games for folk with tight schedules and busy lives.


# Motivation
Soon after graduating college, folk who like to play games together run into a common set of problems. Friends are dispersed all around the world, jobs, families and other responsabilities make scheduling time to play games with your friends fairly impossible, and even if you can get a group together once a week or once a month for a few hours, different folk won't be able to make it on one week or another, keeping the scope of any game to be either short or sporatic.

To get the most out of a game you really want to be able to roleplay and tell stories with your group of friends over a series of sessions. The most fun out of any game is after the fact, when you get together with your friends 10 years later and remember the surprising turns that a particular story took. But it takes multiple sessions and continuity to create something meaningful that is worth remembering. So how can we foster that continuity in a world of tight schedules?


# A Solution
The internet is a great medium for non realtime communication. Play by email games and games that use forum software for their communication and diplomacy have worked well for folk who use them. But they either don't have any interfaces for things like maps and inventories or they tend to require downloading custom clients that only work on one operating system or another.

The solution is to create some user interface components that work in browsers and can be used to create maps, characters and inventories of things as well as a skeleton that brings them together in a common use case so that folk can create game worlds and use them to run non-realtime storytelling games.


# Not A Solution
A specific non-goal of Turnstyles is to cater to realtime game mechanics. There are a lot of great game mechanics that tabletop games employ like auctions or instant reaction cards that really require that the players are all present at once.

That's not the goal here. Chat or voice discussion can be allowed as an extra, but any game mechanics should generally not rely on the response of other players for at least a day if not a week or more.

The average turn should take an hour or two a week or 3 or 4 hours a month and not require any response on any faster timetable than that.
